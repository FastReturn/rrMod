Hi, I’m rrMod and I’m here to make your life easier.
I’ll generate and send all the emails you’d need to
send to update your routing registry so that you can
do more important things with your life...

What you'll need:
- PHP (preferably PHP 5.4)
- The PHP5-PDO extension
- ARIN routing registry access

Installation instructions:
- Download all the files in the directory
- Upload them to a webserver
- Access index.php via a browser
